# ARM Microcontroller-Based VSI Controller for the QUT Microgrid

## Overview

This project aims to develop and deploy modern ARM-based microcontroller firmware (e.g., STM32G431/G474) to control three-phase Voltage Source Inverters (VSIs) with LCL filters in the QUT Microgrid. These inverters will operate in grid-forming or grid-following modes, replacing legacy TMS320 DSP-based controllers.

## Objectives

- Develop robust C code for ARM Cortex-M microcontrollers to control VSIs  
- Interface with existing or new VSI hardware  
- Demonstrate grid-forming operation with LCL filter-connected VSIs  
- Support future research into advanced inverter control strategies  

## Background

Australia's energy landscape is rapidly evolving, with a shift from centralized synchronous generation to distributed renewable energy sources. The QUT Microgrid reflects this transition, incorporating multiple DERs and requiring advanced inverter control to ensure stability, compliance, and interoperability.

Key drivers:
- Retirement of coal-fired power stations  
- Annual addition of ~6 GW renewable capacity (AEMO ISP, 2024)  
- 20% of electricity generated by non-sector DERs (DCCEEW, 2024)  

## Literature Review Highlights

- VSIs are central to modern grid design  
- Control requirements include:  
  - Synchronization  
  - Anti-islanding  
  - Voltage/frequency regulation  
  - DC injection mitigation  
  - Grounding and protection  
  - Utility communication  
- ARM-based digital control offers flexibility, scalability, and performance
